### Categorical Data Analysis with Logistic Regression and Random Forest Models

This project explored two types of primary models used in solving classification problems: the logistic regression model is useful for quick implementation with good accuracy, and the random forest model is robust with the Out of Bag (OOB) estimates. The data was obtained from Kaggle and had been split into training set and test set. 

In Part 1 of the proejct, I discuessed data cleaning, data exploration, details of logistic regression modeling and analysis, and model evaluation with regularization. In Part 2, similar discussion was presented with the random forest model. The project was written in R Markdown format, and the R script can be found in this repository.
